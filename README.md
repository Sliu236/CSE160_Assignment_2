 Other clarifications: The code contained in this assignment is derived in large part from the YouTube playlists(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xgejUPmGgo&list=PLbyTU_tFIkcPmW6JknG_z9jdWDpJt7DYS&ab_channel=UCSCCSE160) provided with the course. At the same time I accomplished this assignment with the help of artificial intelligence (Chatgpt, deepseek) especially in the area of object movement logic. if this inadvertently violates any of the terms regarding academic integrity, please contact me promptly!
